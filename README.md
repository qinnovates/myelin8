# Engram

**Architecting Brain's Memory To Solve AI Context Persistence**

*A security engineer's approach to tackling AI context persistence and hardware constraints by modeling how the human brain stores and retrieves memory.*

AI context windows have a hard limit. Fill it up and the oldest memories fall off. Your assistant forgets what you told it last week.

Engram solves this the way the brain does.

Your brain doesn't hold everything in working memory at once. It uses a tiered architecture: the **prefrontal cortex** keeps ~7 items in active firing for immediate access (hot). The **hippocampus** consolidates recent experiences over hours and days, replaying them during sleep into longer-term storage (warm). The **neocortex** stores long-term memories distributed across cortical regions, reconstructed from fragments when the right cue triggers recall (cold). And the deepest memories — the ones you haven't accessed in months or years — take real effort and the right context to surface, like the tip-of-tongue phenomenon (frozen).

Each tier trades retrieval speed for storage efficiency. That's not a limitation. It's what lets the system scale across decades.

This isn't a new idea in AI. DeepSeek-V2 ([arXiv:2405.04434](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04434)) applied the same principle to attention itself: instead of recalculating full key/value tensors for every token, they precompute and cache compressed latent vectors — reducing KV cache by 93.3% and achieving 5.76x throughput. Same insight: don't recompute what you can store compressed and recall on demand.

Engram applies this to your AI's *memory*. It solves three problems at once:

**Context persistence.** Your AI's memory doesn't disappear when the context window fills up. Old sessions compress into searchable tiers instead of being dropped. Months of decisions, code reviews, and conversations stay accessible through the semantic index — no re-explaining required.

**Hardware constraints.** Expanding AI memory means expanding disk usage. Without compression, six months of daily sessions consumes gigabytes. Engram's multi-stage pipeline (4-5x warm, 8-12x cold, 20-50x frozen) shrinks that footprint by 90%+ while keeping everything searchable. You don't need more hardware. You need smarter storage.

**Security risks of expanded memory.** More memory means more data at risk. Every session you've ever had — stored in plaintext on disk. Engram adds optional post-quantum encryption (ML-KEM-768 hybrid) so your expanded memory is protected at rest. Per-artifact keys. Per-tier keypairs. Private keys handled by a compiled Rust sidecar that never lets them enter Python.

No additional setup needed to expand memory. Run `engram init` (auto-detects your AI assistants), then `engram run` (compresses and indexes everything). Your AI immediately has access to months of context through the semantic index. The context window didn't get bigger. The memory behind it got smarter.

```

### Least Privilege by Design

The tiered architecture isn't just compression. It's the principle of least privilege applied to AI context.

Traditional least privilege: a user only gets the permissions they need for the current task. Engram least privilege: the AI only gets the context fidelity it needs for the current task.

| Tier | Access Level | What the AI Sees | Analogy |
|------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Hot** | Full access | Complete session content, every token | Root access — current working set |
| **Warm** | Summaries | Key decisions, outcomes, compressed context | Read access — recent history |
| **Cold** | Keywords only | Semantic index entries, topic references | Directory listing — you know it exists |
| **Frozen** | Explicit recall required | Nothing until `engram recall` is invoked | Locked vault — must request access |

The constraint is real: the context window is finite. The enforcement is real: compression removes detail until you explicitly ask for it back. Old context doesn't linger at full fidelity. It compresses, indexes, and locks down — the same way a well-run system revokes elevated permissions after the task is done.

This means a compromised or misbehaving AI session can't silently access months of full-fidelity conversation history. It gets summaries and keywords. Full recall requires an explicit action (`engram recall <path>`) that can be logged, rate-limited, or gated behind encryption. The blast radius of any single session is bounded by its tier.

Add post-quantum encryption and the tiers become actual access barriers: even with disk access, frozen artifacts are ML-KEM-768 encrypted with per-artifact keys managed by a Rust sidecar that never lets private keys enter Python's address space.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install engram
engram init                              # guided setup
engram run --dry-run                     # preview (safe, no changes)
engram run                               # compress + encrypt
engram search "authentication refactor"  # search all tiers
engram context --query "auth patterns"   # get context for your AI
engram recall <path>                     # decompress a cold artifact
engram status                            # tier distribution
```

### Enable encryption

```bash
cd engram/sidecar && cargo build --release        # build crypto sidecar
engram encrypt-setup                              # generate keys + store in Keychain
```

## How It Works

**Brain-inspired tiering.** Artifacts move through tiers based on age and idle time:

| Transition | When | Pipeline | Ratio |
|-----------|------|----------|-------|
| Hot → Warm | 1 week old + 3 days idle | Minify JSON → zstd-3 | 4-5x |
| Warm → Cold | 1 month old + 2 weeks idle | Strip boilerplate → dict-trained zstd-9 | 8-12x |
| Cold → Frozen | 3 months old + 1 month idle | Columnar Parquet + dict + zstd-19 | 20-50x |

All thresholds configurable. Choose 2-tier (simple) or 4-tier (full) during setup.

**Hybrid search.** Every artifact is indexed with keywords, embeddings, LSH hashes, and HNSW graph entries before compression. Search uses a 6-layer retrieval stack: keyword lookup, LSH hash tables, HNSW nearest-neighbor graphs, Reciprocal Rank Fusion (BM25 + vector), optional reranking, and summary output. The index (~1 MB keywords + ~10 MB embeddings for 10K artifacts) is always loaded, never compressed. Search across all tiers without decompressing anything. Summaries load at 10-20% of token cost. Full recall on demand.

**Everything local.** No data leaves your machine. No telemetry. No cloud dependency. Zero network calls.

---

## Compression Pipeline

Not just "higher zstd levels" (that gets 3.2x to 3.8x). Each tier applies different data transformations:

- **Warm:** JSON minification strips 30-40% of whitespace before zstd-3
- **Cold:** Boilerplate stripping replaces repeated system prompts (2,000-5,000 tokens per session) with 64-byte hash refs. Dictionary trained on your session logs teaches zstd the shared schema. Only unique content gets compressed.
- **Frozen:** JSONL transposed to columnar Parquet. `role` column (cardinality 2) → run-length encoded to nothing. `timestamp` column (monotonic) → delta encoded to nothing. Only `content` carries entropy. ClickHouse achieves 170x on logs with this approach.

### Real results

```
4,564 artifacts | 2.6 GB raw | 11.62x ratio | 1.6 GB saved | 132K keywords indexed
```

## Encryption

Optional. Engram works without it — compression, indexing, and context enhancement all function with zero encryption.

When enabled, uses **ML-KEM-768** (NIST FIPS 203) in hybrid mode with X25519, using AES-256-GCM (NIST FIPS 197) for data encryption and HKDF-SHA256 (NIST SP 800-56C) for key derivation.

### Crypto sidecar (engram-vault)

Private keys are handled by a compiled **Rust binary** — not Python. Keys never enter Python's address space, never touch disk, never appear in process args, never hit swap.

| Protection | How |
|-----------|-----|
| Keys out of Python | Rust sidecar is the crypto boundary |
| Keys off disk | OS credential vault → mlock'd memory → in-process crypto → zeroed |
| Keys out of swap | `mlockall()` at startup |
| Keys out of core dumps | `setrlimit(RLIMIT_CORE, 0)` |
| Keys out of logs | Regex PII detector blocks secrets before writing |
| No env hijack | `.env_clear()` on all subprocess calls |
| Zeroize on all paths | `Zeroizing<T>` wrappers on all key material — errors, panics, normal exit |

### Key material lifecycle

Private keys are **never** stored as environment variables and **never** passed over any wire or socket.

| Step | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Storage** | Private keys live in your OS credential vault — macOS Keychain (encrypted by the OS, protected by login password/Touch ID), Windows Credential Manager (DPAPI-backed), or Linux `libsecret`/GNOME Keyring. The vault encrypts keys at rest using OS-level protections. |
| **2. Retrieval** | The Rust sidecar calls the OS credential API (Security.framework on macOS) to read the key directly into its own `mlock`'d memory. No intermediate files, no pipes, no env vars. |
| **3. Usage** | Key material stays in-process only. Used for ML-KEM-768 decapsulation + X25519 Diffie-Hellman + HKDF-SHA256 key derivation + AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt. All NIST-approved algorithms. |
| **4. Cleanup** | `Zeroizing<Vec<u8>>` wrappers (RustCrypto `zeroize` crate) ensure deterministic zeroing on ALL exit paths — normal return, error return, and panic. Compiler barriers prevent the optimizer from eliding the zeroing. This satisfies NIST SP 800-57 Part 1 Section 8.3 key destruction requirements. |
| **5. Never** | Touches disk. Enters Python. Appears in process args. Passes through env vars. Goes over any wire or socket. Gets logged. Hits swap (`mlockall`). Appears in core dumps (`RLIMIT_CORE=0`). |

The Python side only ever sees the **public key** (for encryption). The sidecar is the crypto boundary.

### Two modes

| | Simple | Envelope |
|---|---|---|
| Keys | One for all tiers | Per-tier keypairs |
| Per-artifact isolation | No | Yes — unique 256-bit DEK each |
| Compromise radius | All data | One tier or one artifact |
| Key rotation | Re-encrypt all (O(data)) | Re-wrap headers (O(metadata)) |

### Why post-quantum now

NIST [IR 8547](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2024/NIST.IR.8547.ipd.pdf) (draft, Nov 2024): RSA-2048/P-256 deprecated by 2030, disallowed by 2035. "Harvest now, decrypt later" is a real threat. Starting with classical crypto means migrating before 2030. Start with PQ and you're done.

## Architecture

For the full detailed walkthrough of how every component works — registration, tier transitions, compression pipeline, hybrid search retrieval stack, HNSW vector index, embedding architecture, recall flow, encryption lifecycle, lookup tables, and index encryption — see **[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

**KV cache reduction through lookup tables.** The same insight that makes DeepSeek-V2 fast applies here: don't recompute what you can store compressed and look up. Every retrieval path in Engram uses precomputed structures — inverted keyword indexes (O(1) per keyword), LSH hash tables (O(1) approximate nearest neighbor), HNSW graphs (O(log n) exact nearest neighbor), Product Quantization codebooks (192x embedding compression), and trained compression dictionaries. The net effect: 10,000-artifact search completes in under 50ms without decompressing a single file.

## Security

- 10 rounds of security review (red team, crypto, GRC, supply chain, OWASP, embedding injection, index encryption, lookup table integrity, hybrid search fuzzing)
- Rust crypto sidecar — keys never in Python
- PQ encryption (ML-KEM-768 + X25519 hybrid)
- Per-artifact DEKs in envelope mode
- Audit logging with regex PII/secret detection
- SHA-256 integrity verification
- Symlink protection, path containment, sensitive directory blocklist
- Input validation (newlines/nulls rejected in protocol)
- Core dumps disabled, memory locked, environment cleared
- No `shell=True` anywhere

### Threat model

**Protects against:** data at rest on stolen devices, harvest-now-decrypt-later, unauthorized disk reads, forensics on decommissioned hardware.

**Does NOT protect against:** compromised process with same-UID ptrace, attacker with your Keychain password, trojanized `age` binary, root compromise on non-Secure-Enclave hardware.

### Recommendations

See the full [security recommendations](#security-recommendations) section for the 10-point hardening guide (shared server isolation, cron lockdown, key compromise response, secure uninstall, etc.).

---

## Use Cases

**Solo dev:** 6 months of sessions → compressed from 200 MB to 15 MB. Search past decisions without re-explaining.

**Security researcher:** Sessions contain exploits and disclosure timelines. PQ envelope encryption. Touch ID on recall. Private keys in Keychain-backed Keychain.

**Team server:** Shared `~/.claude/`. Per-user encryption keys. Semantic index lets everyone search. Content isolation via per-tier keypairs.

**Multi-project:** Point Engram at 5 project memory dirs. Cross-project search finds the answer regardless of which project it was in.

---

## Configuration

All thresholds configurable in `~/.engram/config.json`:

## Disclaimer

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.** This software is provided as-is under the MIT license with no warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

**Data handling.** Engram compresses and optionally encrypts files on your local filesystem. Compression transformations (JSON minification, boilerplate stripping) are lossy for whitespace. Full semantic content is preserved and recoverable via `engram recall`, but byte-for-byte identity with the original file is not guaranteed after tiering.

**Encryption limitations.** If you lose your private key, encrypted data is unrecoverable. There is no backdoor, no recovery mechanism, no reset. The encryption is only as strong as your key management. The Rust crypto sidecar uses the ml-kem (v0.2, RustCrypto), aes-gcm (v0.10, RustCrypto), and x25519-dalek (v2) crates. These crates have not received a combined independent audit specific to this integration.

**Not a certified security product.** Engram has been reviewed through multiple rounds of automated security analysis but has not been formally audited by an independent security firm, is not FIPS-validated, and does not hold any compliance certifications. It is not a substitute for an HSM, a certified KMS, or a CMVP-validated crypto module.

**No liability for data loss.** The author is not responsible for data loss, corruption, unauthorized access, or any damages resulting from use of this software. Back up your data before enabling compression or encryption. Test `engram recall` before relying on it for critical data.

**Regulatory compliance is your responsibility.** Engram provides technical controls (encryption, audit logging, access separation) but does not constitute compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI-DSS, or any other framework. Consult your compliance team.
